<p>
  Maintenance Tracker was created to log maintance items done by users on their vehicles. Users can add the name of the repair, milleage, and a description. Users can then access their previous logs, and delete/update them.
  
  What makes this app unique is that it was created in SwiftUI, and uses core data. It was challenging using core data with SwitUI becuase not much documention exists on this topic, so in many ways this was a learning opportunity.
